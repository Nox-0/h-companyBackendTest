Hello, this is Danila Bublik's Backend Developer Test for [h-company] NZ

There are two easy ways to run the app.

If your IDE can run the app:
1) Open the IDE
2) Open this project in the IDE
3) Build/Run `BackendTestApplication.java` located in `/backendTest/src/main/java/com.halter.backendTest/`

If your IDE cannot run the app:
1) Open your terminal
2) Change your directory to `/backendTest/`
3) Enter `mvn clean package` into the terminal

To use the functionality (make sure the app is running):
1) Open Postman
2) Import a new collection
3) Select the file `Postman/Halter Cows Backend Test.postman_collection.json` OR select Raw text and copy/paste everything in the file
4) Use the endpoints by clicking SEND

Testing:
1) Open your terminal
2) Change your directory to `/backendTest/`
3) Enter `mvn test` into the terminal

Or run the tests from your IDE <3

Thanks!
Danila
